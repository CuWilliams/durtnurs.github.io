# robots.txt for durtnurs.com
# Prevents search engines from indexing protected Fan Club area
#
# IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING:
# =======================
# This is a POLITE REQUEST to compliant web crawlers.
# This is NOT enforcement or access control.
#
# What this does:
# - Tells well-behaved search engine bots (Google, Bing, etc.) to skip certain pages
# - Helps prevent Fan Club content from appearing in search results
# - Works in combination with meta robots tags in HTML
#
# What this does NOT do:
# - Does not prevent direct access via URL
# - Does not stop malicious bots (they ignore robots.txt)
# - Does not provide security
# - Does not hide content from determined users
#
# For this hobby band website, this level of protection is perfect.
# We're creating a "members only" feeling, not Fort Knox.

# Default rule: Allow all bots to index main site
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Disallow Fan Club area (members only)
# This prevents indexing but does NOT prevent direct access
Disallow: /fanclub.html

# Optional: Prevent indexing of JavaScript files
# (Uncomment if you want to prevent bots from reading JS source)
# Disallow: /assets/js/fanclub-auth.js
# Disallow: /assets/js/fanclub-gallery.js

# Sitemap location (if you create one in the future)
# Sitemap: https://durtnurs.com/sitemap.xml

# ============================================
# EDUCATIONAL NOTES
# ============================================
#
# robots.txt Syntax:
# - User-agent: * means "all bots"
# - User-agent: Googlebot would target only Google
# - Allow: / means "everything is allowed by default"
# - Disallow: /path means "don't index this path"
# - # comments are ignored by bots
#
# Testing:
# - Visit https://durtnurs.com/robots.txt to see this file
# - Google Search Console has a robots.txt tester
# - Most search engines respect this file
#
# Alternative approaches for real security:
# - Server-side authentication (login systems)
# - .htaccess password protection (Apache servers)
# - Cloudflare Access (managed authentication)
# - OAuth/SAML integration
# - VPN-only access
#
# But for casual friends-only gatekeeping? This + meta robots is perfect.
