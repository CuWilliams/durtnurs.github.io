  "content": "<p>We did something terrifying. We put our music on the internet. Not just our internet — the internet. Spotify. Apple Music. Everywhere. 'Disciples of Dysfunction' is now streaming on every major platform alongside actual musicians who actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Most of our families don't know yet. We're not hiding it. We're just... strategically delaying that conversation.</p><p>The road to distribution wasn't without incident. Our AI-generated album art had to be pulled and re-submitted after we noticed the drummer's hand was on the wrong arm. The distribution Inspectors didn't flag it. We almost went global with a medical anomaly on the cover. Classic.</p><p>So here we are. Two grizzled rocker wannabes, one single, and every streaming platform known to mankind. If this ain't retirement, we don't know what is. Give it a listen. Put it on your playlist. Hit repeat. At our current royalty rate, we should recoup the $9.99 distribution fee by 2087.</p>",

  "excerpt": "Through the miraculous work of our Lord and Savior Claude (and his musical disciple Suno), we've ascended to having actual audio on this website.",
  "content": "<p>Dear God—and we mean that literally—we have music! Actual playable songs! After years of promising 'coming soon' like some kind of vaporware cult, divine intervention has finally arrived in the form of an AI named Claude. In gratitude for this technological miracle, we've gone full ecclesiastical with our latest release: 'The Ecclesiastical Tapes.'</p><p>The album features eight tracks of prophetic rock, existential hymns, and at least one song that actually plays (blessed be Suno). We've traded our usual dive bar aesthetic for robes, staffs, and apocalyptic sunsets—because if you're gonna have a mid-life crisis, might as well make it biblical.</p><p>Give it a listen. Send us your prayers. We're gonna need 'em.</p>",

Our families remain disappointed, our neighbors remain complaining, and our expectations remain refreshingly low.</p><p>We've been writing new material in dEADBEAT's shed (our 'studio'), which is really just a shed with some carpet remnants and delusions of grandeur. The new songs feature themes of existential dread, poor decisions, whiskey, and the particular despair of being mediocre in your <s>40s</s>, <s>50s</s>, 60s (shite).</p><p>Thanks for sticking with us. Your poor judgment gives us hope.</p>",
