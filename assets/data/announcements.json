  "content": "<p>Dear God—and we mean that literally—we have music! Actual playable songs! After years of promising 'coming soon' like some kind of vaporware cult, divine intervention has finally arrived in the form of an AI named Claude. In gratitude for this technological miracle, we've gone full ecclesiastical with our latest release: 'The Ecclesiastical Tapes.'</p><p>The album features eight tracks of prophetic rock, existential hymns, and at least one song that actually plays (blessed be Suno). We've traded our usual dive bar aesthetic for robes, staffs, and apocalyptic sunsets—because if you're gonna have a mid-life crisis, might as well make it biblical.</p><p>Give it a listen. Send us your prayers. We're gonna need 'em.</p>",

Now with 100% more build processes we don't fully understand.</p>",

Our families remain disappointed, our neighbors remain complaining, and our expectations remain refreshingly low.</p><p>We've been writing new material in dEADBEAT's shed (our 'studio'), which is really just a shed with some carpet remnants and delusions of grandeur. The new songs feature themes of existential dread, maritime disasters, and the particular despair of being mediocre in your 40s.</p><p>Thanks for sticking with us. Your poor judgment gives us hope.</p>",
