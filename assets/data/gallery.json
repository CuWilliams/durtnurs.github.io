/*
 * GALLERY DATA STRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION
 *
 * This JSON file stores all photo and video media for the dURT nURS' gallery system.
 * It supports both the public gallery (Phase 5) and the full Fan Club gallery (Phase 6).
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * PHASE 5 vs PHASE 6: THE PUBLIC FLAG
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * The "public" flag is CRITICAL for the dual gallery system:
 *
 * PUBLIC GALLERY (Phase 5 - gallery.html):
 * - Shows ONLY items where "public": true
 * - Curated, family-friendly content
 * - Anyone can view without login
 * - Filtered using: media.filter(item => item.public === true)
 *
 * FAN CLUB GALLERY (Phase 6 - fanclub.html):
 * - Shows ALL items (public: true AND public: false)
 * - Behind-the-scenes, exclusive content
 * - Requires password/access control
 * - No filtering applied: displays entire media array
 *
 * This approach allows us to maintain ONE data source for both galleries,
 * simplifying content management while enabling access control.
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * MEDIA ITEM STRUCTURE
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Each media object contains these properties:
 *
 * id (string, required):
 *   - Unique identifier in kebab-case
 *   - Format: "photo-001" or "video-001"
 *   - Used for: DOM element IDs, deep linking, JavaScript references
 *   - Must be unique across all media items
 *
 * type (string, required):
 *   - Media type: "photo" or "video"
 *   - Used for: rendering logic, UI styling, lightbox behavior
 *   - Photos display as <img>, videos display as <iframe> embeds
 *
 * title (string, required):
 *   - Media title/caption
 *   - Displayed prominently on card
 *   - Keep concise (3-6 words ideal)
 *
 * description (string, required):
 *   - Brief description or context
 *   - 1-2 sentences
 *   - Include band humor and personality
 *
 * filename (string, required for photos):
 *   - Path to full-size image relative to assets/images/
 *   - Example: "photo-001.jpg"
 *   - Full path becomes: assets/images/gallery/photo-001.jpg
 *   - Used in lightbox for full-size display
 *
 * thumbnail (string, required for photos):
 *   - Path to thumbnail image relative to assets/images/
 *   - Example: "photo-001-thumb.jpg"
 *   - Thumbnails should be ~400px wide for performance
 *   - Why separate thumbnails? Faster page load, better mobile performance
 *
 * embedUrl (string, required for videos):
 *   - Full YouTube/Vimeo embed URL
 *   - Format: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
 *   - NOT the watch URL - must be embed format
 *   - Used in lightbox <iframe> for video playback
 *
 * date (string, required):
 *   - Date media was created/captured
 *   - Format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
 *   - Why ISO? Universal standard, sortable, parseable by JavaScript Date()
 *   - Used for: sorting gallery, displaying dates, filtering by timeframe
 *
 * category (string, required):
 *   - Content category for organization/filtering
 *   - Values: "band", "performance", "backstage", "historical", "misc"
 *   - Used for: potential future filtering UI, visual styling variations
 *   - Allows users to browse by category in Phase 6 enhancements
 *
 * public (boolean, required):
 *   - Access control flag
 *   - true = Show in public gallery (gallery.html)
 *   - false = Show ONLY in Fan Club gallery (fanclub.html)
 *   - This is the PRIMARY filter for Phase 5 gallery
 *   - Set to false for behind-the-scenes, exclusive, or member-only content
 *
 * featured (boolean, required):
 *   - Highlight flag for special items
 *   - true = Display with special styling (larger card, prominent border)
 *   - false = Normal card styling
 *   - Use for: newest content, best photos, important announcements
 *   - Only 1-2 items should be featured at a time
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * IMAGE PATH CONVENTIONS
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * All images are stored in: assets/images/gallery/
 *
 * File naming convention:
 * - Full images: [id].jpg (example: photo-001.jpg)
 * - Thumbnails: [id]-thumb.jpg (example: photo-001-thumb.jpg)
 *
 * Thumbnail strategy:
 * - Create thumbnails at ~400px width
 * - Maintain original aspect ratio
 * - Use compression (80% JPEG quality)
 * - Why? Dramatically reduces page load time on mobile
 * - Full images load only when clicked (in lightbox)
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * This structure supports future features like:
 * - Category filtering (buttons to show only "band" or "performance" photos)
 * - Date range filtering (show photos from specific year)
 * - Search functionality (search titles and descriptions)
 * - Photo upload system (admin interface to add new media)
 * - Pagination (show 12 items per page)
 * - Lazy loading (load images as user scrolls)
 * - Social sharing (share individual photos)
 * - Comments/reactions (Phase 6+ with authentication)
 *
 * =============================================================================
 * CONTENT MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * To add new media:
 * 1. Add image files to assets/images/gallery/
 * 2. Create thumbnail versions (400px width)
 * 3. Add new object to this JSON array
 * 4. Set "public": true for public gallery
 * 5. Set "public": false for Fan Club exclusive content
 * 6. Set "featured": true for 1-2 newest/best items
 * 7. Gallery will automatically update on next page load
 *
 * No code changes required - this is pure data management!
