  CHECKOUT PAGE
  Dead-end page with humorous messaging
  This page is intentionally minimal - uses base-message.njk layout
  No header/footer navigation to emphasize the "trapped" experience
-->
<main class="message-container" role="main">
  <div class="message-content">

    <!--
      MAIN MESSAGE
      The big question nobody expected to answer

    <!--
      RESPONSE MESSAGE
      The band's "helpful" response

    <p class="checkout-subtext">
      Well... we'll go find a cash register. So, sit tight.

      WAITING ANIMATION
      Animated dots to simulate "searching"

      Still looking. Have you considered that this might be a sign?

      EXIT BUTTON
      Standard "Get Me Out of Here" button - returns to merch page
