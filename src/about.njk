    <h2 id="story-heading" class="section-heading">Who We Are</h2>
    <div class="story-content">
      <p>We are tHE dURT nURS'—an alive and kicking rock band that's all about fun and good times. But seriously, we ain't that good! (Yet. Give us time.  We are practicing monthly now that we are retired. Hmmm... we actually don't have much time.)</p>

      <p>Here's the thing: we believe in ourselves, we like our brand, and we're having the time of our lives. We're a couple of retired farts who spent decades in the working world doing what responsible adults do—which is to say, NOT pursuing our lifelong passion for creating and recording original music. Noble ambitions? Sure. But life is life, and sometimes you just got to pay that mortgage (ffs).</p>

      <p>Fast forward to today: we've got time, we've got technology, and we've got AI. Those hand-scribbled lyrics and iPhone recordings that sounded like dying animals? With help from Claude and Suno, they're turning into actual music. Solid gold? Nah. Solid pyrite? Absolutely. We're finally creating what we always heard in our heads but could never pull off with just two guys and a dream (and questionable musical ability).</p>

      <p>We've jammed together for years, played a few parties and dances (never for pay, always for beer), and now we're ready to unleash our nonsense onto the world.</p>
      
      <p>Want to see the transformation? Check out a couple of handwritten originals from 30+ years ago - 'Who's Going?' and 'No Name Song' - newly revived as 'Disciples of Dysfunction'.  We pounded on the guitar and drums as we yelled the lyrics into our iPhones, let Claude and Suno work the production like Butch Vig and voilà!  From incomprehensible scrawl to almost-competent rock music. It's basically a miracle. Blessed Be the Noise indeed.</p>
