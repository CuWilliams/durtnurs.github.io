    <div class="story-content">
      <p>We are tHE dURT nURS'—an alive and kicking rock band that's all about fun and good times. But seriously, we ain't that good! (Yet. Give us time.  We are practicing monthly now that we are retired. Hmmm... we actually don't have much time.)</p>

      <p>Here's the thing: we believe in ourselves, we like our brand, and we're having the time of our lives. We're a couple of retired farts who spent decades in the working world, and now we're doing what we should have done years ago—making noise and having fun.</p>

      <p>And here's a fun fact: AI has opened up a whole new realm of possibility for us. We can fake it until we make it! With a little help from our artificial friends, we're creating the music we've always heard in our heads but could never quite pull off with just two guys and a dream.</p>

      <p>We've jammed together for years, played a few parties and dances (never for pay, always for beer), and now we're ready to unleash our nonsense on the world. Blessed Be the Noise indeed.</p>
