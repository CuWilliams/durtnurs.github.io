            <p>After three years of bourbon-fueled studio sessions and one ill-advised yacht incident, our sophomore album is finally crawling out of the depths. 'Kraken Awakens' features ten tracks of maritime metaphors, whiskey-soaked wisdom, and guitar riffs that sound like a sea monster having an existential crisis.</p>
            <p>Pre-order the chaos now. Your eardrums will thank you. Or sue us. Probably sue us.</p>

            <p>Welcome to our shiny new website, built with modern technology we barely understand. We've upgraded from table layouts to flexbox, which is apparently a big deal in web development circles.</p>
            <p>The site now features responsive design (it works on phones!), progressive enhancement (it works without JavaScript!), and our trademark self-loathing (that's just us!).</p>
            <p>Special thanks to our AI overlords for helping us fake competence in modern web development.</p>

          <div class="announcement-card__content">
            <p>We're taking our act on the road this December, which is either brave or monumentally stupid. Six ports across the North Atlantic, eight different dive bars (we're playing two ports twice because apparently we hate ourselves), and absolutely zero rehearsals planned.</p>
            <p>Tickets are available at participating venues, which is a fancy way of saying 'show up and throw money at the bartender.' First come, first served, first to leave when we play our experimental jazz fusion number.</p>
            <p>Ports include: Port Anne, Port Royal, Port Blandford, Van Tupes Tawny Port, and two surprise locations we haven't figured out yet. Stay tuned for actual dates once we consult a calendar.</p>
