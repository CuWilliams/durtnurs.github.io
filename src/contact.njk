        If you want something, you better get on with it cause we ain't got much time left
        (being retired and partially senile) and if you are spamming us then we will hunt you
        down and do something nasty to you. Either way, we likely won't respond.

            We occasionally respond to gig offers, especially if the venue has a liquor license

            We'll talk to anyone with a microphone and questionable judgment. Bonus points
            if you bring whiskey. We have lots of stories, most of them embellished.

            Letters of adoration are read aloud in the shed while we tune our instruments

        We're serious about the spam thing. If you're a bot, a scammer, or trying to
        sell us extended warranties, consider this your only warning. DeadBeat has a
        particular set of skills (mostly drum-related) and SnowMan knows where you live
        (he doesn't, but it sounds threatening).
