      <section>
        <p>
          Welcome to the privacy policy for tHE dURT nURS'. If you're reading this, you either
          have too much time on your hands or you're actually concerned about your data privacy.
          Either way, we appreciate your dedication to boredom.
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Real Talk:</strong> This is a parody band website. We don't collect data because
            we can barely collect our thoughts. But for legal purposes (and because it's the responsible
            thing to do), here's what you should know about privacy on this site.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 1: Information We Collect -->
      <section>
        <h2>1. Information We Collect (Or Don't)</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Data We Intentionally Collect</h3>
        <p>
          Honestly? Almost nothing. This website is intentionally low-tech. We don't have analytics,
          we don't have tracking pixels, and we certainly don't have a marketing department (we can
          barely afford a liquor budget).
        </p>

        <p>The only data we might collect includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email addresses:</strong> If you email us at biteme@durtnurs.com, we'll have your email address. We might even read your email in 4-6 weeks when we remember to check our inbox.</li>
          <li><strong>Fan Club info:</strong> If you somehow gain access to our exclusive Fan Club section, we'll remember that you entered the correct password. We won't know who you are, just that someone solved the puzzle. Good for you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Data Your Browser Automatically Sends</h3>
        <p>
          When you visit any website (including ours), your browser automatically sends some technical
          information to the web server. This might include your IP address, browser type, and what
          page you're visiting. This is standard internet stuff—like how the post office needs your
          address to deliver mail.
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Honest Question:</strong> Do we even look at server logs? Probably not. SnowMan
            doesn't know how, and DeadBeat is too busy drinking to care.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: Cookies -->
      <section>
        <h2>2. Cookies (The Digital Kind, Not the Delicious Kind)</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>What are cookies?</strong> No, not the chocolate chip kind (although those are excellent).
          Cookies are tiny text files that websites store on your computer to remember things about you.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1 Cookies We Use</h3>
        <p>
          We use exactly <strong>one (1)</strong> cookie, and only for the Fan Club authentication.
          When you successfully enter the password, we store a cookie so you don't have to enter it
          every time you visit. That's it. That's the whole cookie situation.
        </p>

        <p>This cookie:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only remembers that you know the password (not who you are)</li>
          <li>Expires after 30 days (because we assume you'll forget about us by then)</li>
          <li>Doesn't track you across other websites</li>
          <li>Contains zero personal information</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> We're judging you if you clear your cookies obsessively.
            Not for privacy reasons—we just think it's weird. But hey, you do you.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h3>2.2 Third-Party Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We don't use third-party cookies. No advertising networks, no social media tracking pixels,
          no Google Analytics spying on your every move. Just you, our website, and our questionable
          sense of humor.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 3: How We Use Your Data -->
      <section>
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data (Spoiler: We Don't)</h2>

        <p>
          If you email us, we might use your email address to respond. Shocking, we know. Revolutionary
          use of technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you access the Fan Club, the cookie helps you stay logged in. That's literally the entire
          data processing operation happening on this website.
        </p>

        <p>We will <strong>never</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sell your data to anyone (who would even buy it?)</li>
          <li>Share your information with third parties (we don't have third parties)</li>
          <li>Use your data for marketing purposes (we can barely market ourselves)</li>
          <li>Track your browsing habits (we're not that invested in your internet journey)</li>
          <li>Send you spam (unless you count our occasional musical output as spam)</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Band Philosophy:</strong> We're too disorganized to monetize your data. This isn't
            noble—it's just reality. You're safe here because we're technologically incompetent, not
            because we're virtuous.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Third-Party Services -->
      <section>
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services (AKA The Liquor Store)</h2>

        <h3>4.1 External Links</h3>
        <p>
          Our website contains links to external sites (like our Instagram). When you click those links,
          you leave our site and enter the wild west of Big Tech. Those companies have their own privacy
          policies, which are probably 47 pages long and written by lawyers who charge by the word.
        </p>

        <p>We link to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instagram (@durtnurs):</strong> Their privacy policy is <a href="https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. It's probably terrifying.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> We use Google Fonts for typography. Google might collect some data when fonts load. Their privacy policy is <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Translation:</strong> When we said "third-party services = liquor store," we weren't
            kidding. The only third party we regularly deal with is the guy at the liquor store who
            judges our bourbon purchases. He probably has more data on us than Google.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h3>4.2 Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          This website is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub (owned by Microsoft) has access to server logs
          and technical data. Their privacy policy is <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
          We chose them because they're free and we're broke.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: Your Rights -->
      <section>
        <h2>5. Your Rights (Yes, You Have Some)</h2>

        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you might have legal rights regarding your data. Here's what
          you can do:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can ask what data we have about you. (Answer: probably just your email if you contacted us.)</li>
          <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can ask us to delete your data. Send us an email and we'll delete it immediately (or whenever we check our email next).</li>
          <li><strong>Correction:</strong> If we have incorrect information about you, let us know and we'll fix it.</li>
          <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can opt out of... well, there's nothing to opt out of. We don't have mailing lists or marketing campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>GDPR Compliance (Sort Of):</strong> If you're in the EU, you have extra rights under
            GDPR. We're compliant mostly by accident—we simply don't collect enough data to violate it.
            It's like being a law-abiding citizen because you're too lazy to commit crimes.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <p>
          To exercise any of these rights, email us at <a href="mailto:biteme@durtnurs.com">biteme@durtnurs.com</a>.
          Include "Privacy Request" in the subject line if you want us to actually notice it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 6: Data Security -->
      <section>
        <h2>6. Data Security (Or Lack Thereof)</h2>

        <p>
          We take data security seriously. By which we mean: we don't collect data, so there's nothing
          to secure. It's the ultimate security strategy—can't have a data breach if there's no data
          to breach.
        </p>

        <p>That said:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>This website uses HTTPS (the little lock icon in your browser), which encrypts data between your device and the server.</li>
          <li>We don't store passwords in a database (the Fan Club password is checked client-side via JavaScript).</li>
          <li>Any emails you send us are stored in our email inbox with whatever security Gmail provides (probably decent, but we didn't set it up).</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Honest Security Assessment:</strong> Our biggest security vulnerability is that
            DeadBeat uses "password123" for everything. But since we don't have admin panels or databases,
            this hasn't been a problem yet. Knock on wood.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 7: Children's Privacy -->
      <section>
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy (Please Be 18+)</h2>

        <p>
          Our website is intended for adults. We don't knowingly collect data from anyone under 18.
          If you're under 18, please get your parents' permission before visiting, and definitely
          don't email us (we're not equipped to talk to minors—we can barely talk to adults).
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're a parent and you discover your child has emailed us, contact us and we'll delete
          their information immediately. Also, maybe have a talk about their music taste.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 8: Changes to Privacy Policy -->
      <section>
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>
          We might update this privacy policy occasionally. Reasons might include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We add new features to the website (unlikely)</li>
          <li>Laws change (more likely)</li>
          <li>We accidentally violate something and need to fix it (most likely)</li>
          <li>We get drunk and decide to rewrite it (odds: 50/50)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When we update this policy, we'll change the "Last Updated" date at the top. We won't email
          you about changes because, again, we don't have your email unless you emailed us first.
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Commitment Level:</strong> We'll try to keep this policy current, but let's be honest—we
            might forget. If you're ever confused about our privacy practices, just assume we're not
            collecting anything because we're too disorganized to do so.
          </p>

        <p>
          Look, we're just a parody rock band with a website. We're not trying to steal your data,
          track your movements, or sell you extended warranties. We're just here to make questionable
          music and even more questionable web content.
        </p>
