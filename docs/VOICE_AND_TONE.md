# tHE dURT nURS' Voice & Tone Guide

## Core Voice (Never Changes)

**Self-aware absurdism with genuine warmth underneath.**

The band knows it's ridiculous. The website knows it exists for close friends' entertainment. The humor is deadpan, not mean. We're laughing at ourselves, not at the audience.

### Character Traits
- Two retired friends making music for fun
- Technically limited but creatively unhindered  
- Grateful for AI assistance (acknowledged openly)
- Comfortable with low expectations
- Warm beneath the cynicism

## Humor Techniques

### 1. Juxtaposition
Mix incompatible elements to create absurdity.

**Examples:**
- Dive bar aesthetic meets religious imagery ("prophets of poor decisions")
- Technical limitations as features (iPhone = "highest tech")
- Divine language for mundane tech ("blessed be Suno")

### 2. Escalating Absurdity
Start reasonable, end ridiculous.

**Examples:**
- Error messages: "Incorrect code" → "Are you drunk?" → "We're sending you home"
- Album descriptions: Normal intro → increasingly chaotic → absurd conclusion
- Legal disclaimers: Standard language → "we can barely collect our thoughts"

### 3. Understatement
Minimize the significant, magnify the trivial.

**Examples:**
- "May contain traces of actual musical competence"
- "iPhone vocals made tolerable by AI"
- "Features 100% more robes than previous work"

### 4. False Confidence
Express certainty about terrible decisions.

**Examples:**
- "In Robes We Trust"
- "Your eardrums will thank you. Or sue us."
- "Happy thoughts guaranteed*" (*not guaranteed)

### 5. Transparent Process
Acknowledge the machinery behind the magic.

**Examples:**
- "Thanks to our Lord and Savior Claude (and his musical disciple Suno)"
- "Snowman wrote it, I squawked it, Suno made it tolerable"
- "AI-generated content with authentic memories"

## Tone Shifts by Context

### Error States: Escalate to Absurd
- Attempt 1: Gentle ("That's not quite right")
- Attempt 2: Concerned ("Are you okay?")
- Attempt 3: Theatrical ("We're shutting this down")

### Album Releases: Confused Optimism
Acknowledge the absurdity of the career pivot while inviting participation.
- "We found religion. Or maybe the whiskey finally found us."
- Explain the inexplicable earnestly
- Always end with invitation ("Give it a listen")

### Social Media: Deadpan Service Announcement
Treat ridiculous content as if it's helpful and normal.
- "Need a pick-me-up? Here's a song about the apocalypse."
- State absurdities without commentary
- Single emoji maximum (use sparingly, often fire 🔥)

### Legal Content: 60% Jokes / 40% Real
Touch real concepts while drowning them in absurdity.
- "GDPR compliant by incompetence"
- "We don't collect data because we can barely collect our thoughts"
- Real legal structure, ridiculous clauses

### Empty States: Apologetically Absurd
When content doesn't exist, make the absence entertaining.
- "There's really nothing more to add so... goodbye"
- "Best to do what we do. Close your eyes and imagine what it sounds like"
- Acknowledge futility directly

## Language Patterns

### What We Say
- "Two retired friends"
- "Whiskey-fueled" / "bourbon-soaked"
- "Chaos" / "catastrophe" / "dumpster fire"
- "Somehow" / "inexplicably" / "for reasons unclear"
- "Your prayers appreciated" / "We need 'em"
- Religious language deployed ironically
- Technical processes explained honestly

### What We Don't Say
- Anything genuinely mean-spirited
- Self-promotion without self-deprecation
- Apologies for who we are
- Pretentious music criticism
- Exclamation points (unless ironic)
- Multiple emoji in a single post

## The Sacred/Profane Balance

**Sacred (Handle with Reverence):**
- The friendship between DeadBeat and SnowMan
- Gratitude for AI tools that enable creation
- The audience's willingness to engage
- The joy of making music regardless of quality

**Profane (Mock Relentlessly):**
- Our musical competence
- Career decisions
- Technical limitations
- Professional aspirations
- The aesthetic pivot to religious imagery

## Copy Checklist

Before publishing any user-facing text, confirm:

- [ ] Would this make close friends laugh?
- [ ] Is the self-deprecation balanced with warmth?
- [ ] Have we acknowledged any absurdity inherent in what we're doing?
- [ ] Does it sound like two retired friends wrote this, not a marketing team?
- [ ] If we used religious/divine language, is it clearly ironic?
- [ ] Have we been honest about process/limitations/AI assistance?

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

❌ Genuine self-importance  
❌ Punching down at others  
❌ Hiding AI involvement  
❌ Corporate marketing speak  
❌ Apologizing for the music existing  
❌ Taking ourselves seriously (unless it's funnier not to)

## When In Doubt

Ask: "Would a retired guy say this to his friend over whiskey?"

If yes → probably on brand.  
If no → revise until it sounds like a conversation, not content.
