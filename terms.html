        <p>
          This is a <strong>PARODY</strong> website. tHE dURT nURS' is a satirical rock band project.
          Nothing on this site should be taken seriously. If you're offended, confused, or taking legal
          action, you've missed the joke entirely.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Terms of Service for tHE dURT nURS'. By accessing this website, you agree
          to these terms. If you don't agree, well... you're probably still going to use the site anyway,
          and we can't actually stop you.
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Legal Credential Check:</strong> These terms were drafted by two middle-aged musicians
            with zero legal training, a Wikipedia article about contract law, and half a bottle of rum.
            If you're expecting actual legal protection, consult a real lawyer (unlike us).
          </p>
        </aside>

        <p>
          These terms outline the rules for using our website. They're mostly common sense mixed with
          self-deprecating humor. If you violate these terms, the consequences will be... well, nothing
          really. We don't have enforcement mechanisms. We're a parody band, not a police state.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 1: Acceptance of Terms -->
      <section>
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <p>
          By using this website (durtnurs.com or durtnurs.github.io), you acknowledge that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You've read these terms (or at least skimmed them)</li>
          <li>You understand this is a parody/satire project</li>
          <li>You agree not to take anything too seriously</li>
          <li>You recognize we're idiots and should be treated as such</li>
          <li>You're at least 18 years old (or have parental supervision, because our content isn't exactly kid-friendly)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you don't agree to these terms, please close this browser tab and go listen to some
          legitimately good music. We recommend literally anything except our own material.

      <!-- Section 2: Nature of Content (PARODY EMPHASIS) -->
      <section>
        <h2>2. This Is Parody (In Case You Missed It)</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Satirical Content</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Everything on this website is satire, parody, and/or artistic expression.</strong>
          This includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>All band member personas (DeadBeat, SnowMan, and any future members)</li>
          <li>All biographical information (mostly fabricated)</li>
          <li>All news announcements (varying degrees of truth)</li>
          <li>All song titles and lyrics (intentionally absurd)</li>
          <li>All claims about musical talent (definitely exaggerated)</li>
          <li>All merchandise descriptions (if we ever make merchandise)</li>
          <li>This terms of service document (seriously, it's mostly jokes)</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>To Be Crystal Clear:</strong> We're not a real touring rock band. We're not signed
            to a label. We don't have corporate sponsors (no liquor company has been brave enough to
            associate with us). This is a creative project that exists somewhere between music, comedy,
            and questionable life decisions.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h3>2.2 Protected Expression</h3>
        <p>
          Our content is protected under freedom of speech and artistic expression laws. We're not
          making factual claims—we're making jokes. If you can't tell the difference, that's on you.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, if something on this site genuinely offends you or crosses a line, please
          <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>. We're satirists, not monsters. We'll probably
          explain the joke, but we might also revise content if we genuinely screwed up.

      <section>
        <h2>3. User Conduct (Don't Be Awful)</h2>

        <h3>3.1 What You Can Do</h3>

          <li>Email us with reasonable messages</li>
          <li>Access the Fan Club if you solve the password puzzle</li>
          <li>Laugh at our jokes (or groan—we'll accept either)</li>
          <li>Tell your friends about us (though we question your judgment)</li>
          <li>Take screenshots for personal use</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 What You Can't Do</h3>
        <p>
          Please don't:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Hack the website (there's nothing to steal anyway)</li>
          <li>Send us spam, viruses, or malicious content</li>
          <li>Impersonate us (why would you want to?)</li>
          <li>Use our content for illegal purposes</li>
          <li>Take our satire seriously and then sue us for defamation</li>
          <li>Attempt to profit from our intellectual property without permission</li>
          <li>Be a jerk in emails or comments (we reserve the right to ignore jerks)</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Common Sense Rule:</strong> Don't do anything you wouldn't do on other websites.
            We're not special. We're just trying to make people laugh while playing mediocre rock music.
            Treat us like you'd treat any other creative project run by well-meaning amateurs.

        <p>
          Email us at <a href="mailto:biteme@durtnurs.com">biteme@durtnurs.com</a> with your request.
          We're generally pretty chill about usage—we just want to know what's happening.
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Honest Assessment:</strong> Our music is so niche and weird that theft isn't really
            a concern. If someone steals our songs, we'll mostly be flattered that they thought it was
            worth stealing. That said, don't be a dick—ask permission.

          guarantee that:

        <ul>
          <li>The website will always be available (it might crash)</li>
          <li>The content will be error-free (we make lots of typos when drunk)</li>

        <h3>5.2 Not Responsible For</h3>
        <p>
          We are <strong>NOT</strong> liable for any damages arising from:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ear damage</strong> from listening to our music at unsafe volumes</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional distress</strong> caused by our lyrics, humor, or general existence</li>

          <li><strong>Relationship problems</strong> caused by subjecting partners to our music</li>
          <li><strong>Existential crises</strong> triggered by our self-aware absurdism</li>

          In the unlikely event a court finds us liable for something, our maximum liability is limited
          to $0.00 USD. We're broke. There's nothing to sue for. Our most valuable asset is a barely
          functioning drum kit and some whiskey bottles (empty).

        <h3>8.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a problem with us, please <a href="contact.html">email us</a> first. We're
          reasonable people (sort of). Most disputes can be resolved through conversation, apology,
          or mutual agreement that the whole thing was dumb.
        </p>

        <h3>8.2 Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          If informal resolution fails, we prefer to settle disputes through arbitration rather than
          court. The arbitration will be conducted via:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Venue:</strong> SnowMan's shed (or a mutually agreed location)</li>
          <li><strong>Arbitrator:</strong> Whoever's sober enough to listen to both sides</li>
          <li><strong>Process:</strong> Each party gets to explain their grievance over whiskey</li>
          <li><strong>Decision:</strong> Binding and final (or until someone forgets what we decided)</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Serious Note:</strong> We don't actually expect legal disputes. This is a free
            website for a parody band. If you're considering legal action, please reconsider your life
            choices. That said, if there's a genuine issue, we'll address it like adults (probably).
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h3>8.3 Governing Law</h3>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the state where we're physically
          located (we're not telling you where—privacy reasons). Any legal action must be filed in a
          court with appropriate jurisdiction.
        </p>

      <!-- Section 9: Changes to Terms -->
      <section>
        <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Reasons might include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Legal requirements change</li>
          <li>We realize we screwed something up</li>
          <li>The website adds new features</li>
          <li>We get drunk and decide to rewrite things</li>
          <li>Someone points out a problem we didn't notice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When we update these terms, we'll change the "Last Updated" date at the top. Continued use
          of the website after changes means you accept the new terms. If you don't accept them, stop
          using the site (and our feelings will be hurt).
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>Promise:</strong> We won't make sneaky changes to screw you over. Any updates will
            be good-faith attempts to improve clarity, fix errors, or comply with laws. We're satirists,
            not scammers.

      <!-- Section 10: Severability -->
      <section>
        <h2>10. Severability (Legal Jargon Required by Law, Probably)</h2>

        <p>
          If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court, the remaining
          parts will still apply. Think of it like our band—if one member is useless (looking at you,
          DeadBeat), the others keep going.
        </p>

      <!-- Section 11: Entire Agreement -->
      <section>
        <h2>11. Entire Agreement</h2>

        <p>
          These terms, along with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute the entire
          agreement between you and tHE dURT nURS' regarding use of this website. There are no secret
          clauses, hidden terms, or verbal agreements. What you see is what you get.

        <p>
          <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:biteme@durtnurs.com">biteme@durtnurs.com</a><br>

        </p>

        <p>
          We'll do our best to respond, but remember: we're not lawyers, we're musicians. If you need

      <!-- Final Note -->
      <section>
        <h2>13. Final Thoughts (Please Don't Sue Us)</h2>

        <p>
          Look, we know nobody reads terms of service documents. You probably scrolled straight to the
          bottom hoping for a summary. Here it is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>This is parody.</strong> Don't take it seriously.</li>
          <li><strong>We're not liable for anything.</strong> Use the site at your own risk.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be a jerk.</strong> Respect our content and other users.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask before using our stuff commercially.</strong> We'll probably say yes.</li>
          <li><strong>We're not professionals.</strong> Manage expectations accordingly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you've actually read this entire document, you deserve a medal (or at least a drink).
          Thanks for engaging with our nonsense. We appreciate you more than we can express (which
          isn't saying much, but still).
        </p>

        <p>
          Now go forth and enjoy the website. Or don't. We're not your boss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Legally yours (sort of),<br>
          <strong>tHE dURT nURS'</strong>
        </p>

        <aside class="legal-aside">
          <p>
            <strong>P.S.</strong> If you're a lawyer and you're reading this professionally, please be
            gentle in your assessment. We did our best with Wikipedia and good intentions. Also, we're
            broke, so pro bono feedback is appreciated.
